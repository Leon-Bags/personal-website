        <h1>When I'm not serving my clients I occupy myself with the following things.</h1>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <img src="imgs\guitar.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="">
            <p>When I was little my mom would sing to me and I would sing along. Growing up and following along, I
                got
                better and started competing in local events. In Highschool I was a lead singer for our band. We
                mostly
                played Pop and RnB in acoustic. When I got in college I tried to compete in The Voice Philippines
                and
                Philippines got talent, twice. Even though I didn't pass the pre-elimination round it was a learning
                experience and I honed my craft in my own way. Nowadays I just play the guitar randomly at
                conventions,
                whenever I have my instrument on me in public or at gatherings. People say I am good for what I do.
                All
                I
                enjoy is sharing music the way I express it to be.

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <img src="imgs\food.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="">
            <p>I also love cooking at home where I dont need to worry about my boss looking over my shoulder.. I
                tend to
                go
                full mad scientist and tend to experiment on all sorts of flavors. Food for me isn't just a basic
                human
                need. To a certain level its a luxury and that is something I want to deliver with my food. I am
                experienced
                in Filipino Cuisine, Japanese Cuisine and currently learning how to work with Hispanic elements. My
                goal
                with my culinary journey is to deliver food vibes that make you feel at home. Like you're sharing a
                meal
                with a loved one.

            <h2>Fitness</h2>
            <img src="imgs\fitness.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="">
            <p>I go to the gym quite regularly. The gym to me is an immaculate practice where I can zone out all my
                thoughts
                and focus on my physical well-being. When I am not at the gym I use the time to go hiking in nature
                reserves
                around the bay area. I frequent Mt. Umunhum and Mission Peak a lot. I also like sharing my
                experiences
                with
                friends who are trying to get into being physically active. So I tend to host meetups and start easy
                so
                people can catch up and slowly build their endurance.

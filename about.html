    <h1>When I'm not serving my clients I occupy myself with the following things.</h1>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <img src="" <!--put something here later--> alt="">
        <p>When I was little my mom would sing to me and I would sing along. Growing up and following along, I got
            better and started competing in local events. In Highschool I was a lead singer for our band. We mostly
            played Pop and RnB in acoustic. When I got in college I tried to compete in The Voice Philippines and
            Philippines got talent, twice. Even though I didn't pass the pre-elimination round it was a learning
            experience and I honed my craft in my own way. Nowadays I just play the guitar randomly at conventions,
            whenever I have my instrument on me in public or at gatherings. People say I am good for what I do. All I
            enjoy is sharing music the way I express it to be.

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <img src="" <!-- put something here later --> alt="">
        <p>I also love cooking at home where I dont need to worry about my boss looking over my shoulder.. I tend to go
            full mad scientist and tend to experiment on all sorts of flavors. Food for me isn't just a basic human
            need. To a certain level its a luxury and that is something I want to deliver with my food. I am experienced
            in Filipino Cuisine, Japanese Cuisine and currently learning how to work with Hispanic elements. My goal
            with my culinary journey is to deliver food vibes that make you feel at home. Like you're sharing a meal
            with a loved one.

        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>I go to the gym quite regularly. The gym to me is an immaculate practice where I can zone out all my thoughts
            and focus on my physical well-being. When I am not at the gym I use the time to go hiking in nature reserves
            around the bay area. I frequent Mt. Umunhum and Mission Peak a lot. I also like sharing my experiences with
            friends who are trying to get into being physically active. So I tend to host meetups and start easy so
            people can catch up and slowly build their endurance.
